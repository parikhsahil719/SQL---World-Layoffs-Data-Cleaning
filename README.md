# Data Cleaning and EDA on World Layoffs Data

This is an introductory project that I used to learn SQL syntax and concepts and apply them to a real data set. Through learning on YouTube, I came across a data analyst video that allowed me to learn SQL and use it through project-based learning.
This project takes world layoff data, cleans the data to turn it into a usable dataset, and performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on it. I am excited to enhance my skills further thanks to this project.
